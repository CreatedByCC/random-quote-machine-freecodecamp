**I prefer to code in VS Code over CodePen**
## Steps I took:
### Getting VS ready:
1. Open the folder where you project folder will be saved
2. Use terminal to install Vite `npm create vite@latest` - I selected React and JS
### Minor tweaks to Vite files:
1. Clear out App.css - here you can add your own styles
2. Clear out most of Index.css - I keep some of the root styles (font-family, line-height and font-weight)
3. Delete the content in the return method of App.jsx
### Start working on your project:
1. I create the entire App in App.jsx first
2. Then I split each section into its own component and fix up the code by adding props
   - Create a jsx file for each component in the src folder
   - Move that section of code from App.jsx to the component jsx file
   - I keep my data in the assets folder inside the src folder in a jsx file
